            Dr. Nikil Jayant on data hiding problems for a Ph.D. degree. Earlier than that,
            he has attended Bilkent University for his M.S. degree and earlier than that he was
            with Middle East Technical University for his B.S. education on Electrical Enginering. He is happy to complete a full circle starting and ending with METU - EEMB department. (You can claim that he has not done any work if the field (which is the vector field) that he is in is conservative. You are right!) 
         <p align="justify">He enjoys reading, listening, watching, discussing, comparing & contrasting anything fancies his mind.
