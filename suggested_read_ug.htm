  <p><strong><font size="+2">Travel Guide For Undergraduate EE Students</font></strong></p>
  <p>This page is prepared to suggest some titles to the undergraduate students 
    of our department (METU-EEE).</p>

   <table border="0" width="80%">
    <tr> 
      <td width="100%"> <p>Travellers carrying the spirit of exploration devour 
          the travel guides before visiting a location. Luckily, it is easy for 
          them to find travel guides with catchy titles such as &quot;Best of 
          Rome&quot;, &quot;Must-see-places-in-Istanbul&quot; in the bookstores. 
          I prefer to call these travellers as <em>space travellers</em>, these 
          travellers visit different (x,y,z) coordinates of earth and eventually 
          come back to their origin, which is their home. </p>
        <p>Students studying science and engineering are also travellers. (I am 
          not talking about the ones wandering in the classroom.) Students sit 
          in a classroom or in a laboratory and get exposed to several decades 
          or centuries of scientific work at every lecture. It is as if, with 
          the guidance of instructors, students visit the academic topics of concern 
          to, say Newton living in 1750's or Maxwell living 1850's day-after day, 
          lecture-after-lecture until graduation. It is interesting that the physical 
          coordinates of the student stays put, but his or her mind travels through 
          several centuries during each one-hour lecture time. Let's call travellers 
          whose mind navigate back and forth between centuries as <em>time-travellers</em>. 
        </p>
        <p>Keeping it brief, the following is the travel guide for the undergraduate 
          students of our department. </p>

                <p><strong>Comments:</strong> This book shows the history of calculus 
                  along with several worked out mathematical examples. Some examples, 
                  such as the ones related with variational calculus, is beyond 
                  the level of our undergraduate education. Yet, this book is 
                  a highly recommended read for all students of calculus. (Book 
                  should be available as a pdf file or can be purchased at a very 
                  low price as a second-hand item from on-line bookstores.)</p></td>

                <p><strong>Comments</strong>: This book is written to uncover 
                  the physical concepts that are at times not-accessible by the 
                  first-time readers of the topic. There are several textbooks 
                  options for Physics 105 courses. This book is not a textbook, 
                  on the contrary it can be taken as a leisure time reading. It 
                  is full of insightful descriptions on basic physical concepts. 
                  Also, this book is compiled from the lectures of the author.

                  covers a great variety of EMT topics, some of which is introduced

                  theory is difficult to fully grasp. This stems from its abstract 
                  nature and also lack of its frequent usage in everyday problems.

                  of complex numbers which are vital to everyday calculations 
                  in all fields of electrical engineering. Older generation of 
                  our BS graduates (who are around 40+ years old, i.e graduates 
                  before 2000) were taking a mandatory course on complex variables 
                  introducing not only the complex valued arithmetic but also 
                  the calculus, which is differentiation, integration, series 
                  expansion with complex valued functions. Readers of this book 
                  can also see some topics of this old course. </p>
