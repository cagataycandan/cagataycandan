<p><strong>Recommendation Letter Policy:</strong></p>
<p>There are different levels of getting to know a person and reflect this knowledge on paper for a potential job application or an application for an academic post. </p>
<p><strong>High Level of Exposure</strong>:   Meeting one-to-one or as a small group for an extensive period of time (conducting a joint project, participating in a project jointly, working together  in a committee, writing a research paper together etc.). This level exposure is admittedly rare; but it is indeed the most valuable and meaningful experience to state in a recommendation letter. </p>
<p><strong>Medium Level of Exposure: </strong>Taking a number of graduate and undergraduate courses (&gt;2) and at the same time participating in the class discussions, homeworks, projects at an extraordinary level (above the average at least). This is a statement on your interest on the topic of the mentioned courses. This information is also valuable for the institute/company that you are applying. It shows an extraordinary level (at least above average) of motivation and desire of involvement in the mentioned topic. </p>
<p><strong>Above Average Level of Exposure: </strong>Taking few number of undergraduate courses ending with the letter grades of BB/BA/AA  and having a good standing in the department (good is a relative term, like voltage!). Your activity in the courses that I have been an instructor shows your interest in the topic and your standing in the department (that is the rank) shows your dicipline and dilligence in general. This is also a valuable information for a possible employer. </p>
<p>Given this, if you believe that I have something valuable to state in a recommendation letter about you, you are of course welcomed to request a letter. </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>When you request a recommendation letter from me, </p>
<p>1. Please come and talk to me briefly. I may not be available at the time or the level of exposure seen from your side and my side may differ. </p>
<p>2. After our mini talk (step 1), please send me your </p>
<ul>
  <li>Statement of purpose (pdf) </li>
  <li>Academic transcript (pdf) </li>
  <li>List of schools/companies that you  are applying with their deadlines</li>
  <li>List of courses you have taken from me </li>
</ul>
<p>through e-mail. </p>
<p>Good luck with your application! Please let me know about the result. </p>
